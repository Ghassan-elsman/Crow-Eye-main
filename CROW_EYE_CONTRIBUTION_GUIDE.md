## Contribution Guidelines

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes**: Fixing issues in existing functionality
- **Feature enhancements**: Adding new features or improving existing ones
- **Documentation**: Improving or adding documentation
- **Testing**: Adding or improving tests
- **UI improvements**: Enhancing the user interface

### Coding Standards

#### Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility

#### Example of Good Code

```python
def parse_prefetch_file(file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Parse a Windows Prefetch file and extract metadata.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the Prefetch file
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing parsed Prefetch metadata
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist
        ValueError: If the file is not a valid Prefetch file
    """
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Prefetch file not found: {file_path}")
        
    # Implementation details...
    
    return prefetch_data
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Branch**: Create a branch for your feature or bugfix
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes following the coding standards

3. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure your changes work as expected

4. **Commit Your Changes**: Use clear commit messages
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
   ```

5. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your fork
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to the main repository

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use the following format for commit messages:

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>
```

Where `<type>` is one of:
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- **test**: Adding or modifying tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```
feat: Add Amcache parser

Implement parser for Amcache.hve to extract application execution history.
Add database schema and UI integration.
```

## Development Workflows

### Adding a New Artifact Parser

1. **Create a new file** in the `Artifacts_Collectors/` directory
2. **Implement the parser** following the existing patterns
3. **Add database functionality** for storing parsed data
4. **Integrate with the UI** by adding necessary components
5. **Update the case management** system to include the new artifact type

### Enhancing the UI

1. **Use the ComponentFactory** to create consistent UI elements
2. **Follow the cyberpunk styling** guidelines in `styles.py`
3. **Ensure responsive design** and proper error handling
4. **Test on different screen sizes** and resolutions

### Improving Data Correlation

1. **Identify common attributes** across artifacts
2. **Implement correlation rules** in the correlation engine
3. **Update the UI** to display correlated data
4. **Test with various datasets** to ensure accuracy

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test with different Windows versions** (7/10/11)
2. **Verify artifact parsing** with known test files
3. **Check UI rendering** on different screen sizes
4. **Validate database operations** and data integrity

### Automated Testing

We're working on implementing automated tests. Contributions in this area are welcome!

   - Look at specific artifact collectors to understand parsing logic

2. **Making Enhancements**:
   - Follow the modular architecture when adding new features
   - Maintain the cyberpunk styling for UI components
   - Ensure proper error handling and logging
   - Add comprehensive documentation for new components

3. **Testing Changes**:
   - Test with different Windows versions (7/10/11)
   - Verify artifact parsing with known test files
   - Check UI rendering on different screen sizes
   - Validate database operations and data integrity

## Roadmap and Future Development

Planned enhancements for Crow Eye include:


- Enhanced LNK file and Jump list structure parsing
- Advanced visualization of artifact timelines
- Reporting functionality for exporting findings

- Timeline Visualization feature
- Correlation engine to correlate Windows Artifacts
- Enhanced search dialog
- Enhanced visualization timeline
